# ğŸš€ Infosys CodeGenie AI â€” Milestone 2  
### ğŸ’¡ Code Generation and Model Comparison using Multiple LLMs

---

## ğŸ§© **Problem Statement**

Develop an **AI-powered Code Generator and Explainer** capable of generating programming code from natural language prompts using multiple open-source language models.  

The system should:
- Generate high-quality, executable code for diverse programming tasks.
- Compare multiple LLMs based on accuracy, output quality, and latency.
- Provide interactive UIs for users to test prompts and visualize performance.

## ğŸ§  **Models Used**

| # | Model | Hugging Face ID | Parameters | Description |
|---|--------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | **DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B** | `deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct` | 1.3B | Lightweight code model optimized for instruction-based generation. |
| 2 | **Phi-2** | `microsoft/phi-2` | 2.7B | A small, efficient model with strong logical and mathematical reasoning. |
| 3 | **Gemma-2B-IT** | `google/gemma-2b-it` | 2B | Instruction-tuned variant of Googleâ€™s Gemma, trained on multi-lingual datasets. |
| 4 | **Stable-Code-3B** | `stabilityai/stable-code-3b` | 3B | Focused on reliable code synthesis and better language diversity. |
| 5 | **Replit-Code-3B** | `replit/replit-code-v1-3b` | 3B | Designed for end-to-end software generation and completion tasks. |
